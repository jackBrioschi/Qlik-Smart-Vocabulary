# Qlik-Smart-Vocabulary

**Qlik-Smart-Vocabulary** is a Node.js tool that connects to a Qlik app via the QIX Engine APIs, retrieves master measures and dimensions, enriches them with synonyms using OpenAI's language models, and automatically populates the app's vocabulary with the enhanced terms.

> [!NOTE]  
> This app modifies the QIX interface to update vocabulary objects in a Qlik Sense app. These objects aren't officially supported by Qlik and could change without notice, which may impact this workflow in the future.

## âœ¨ Features

- Connects to a Qlik app using QIX Engine APIs
- Retrieves all master dimensions and measures
- Uses OpenAI's API to generate intelligent synonyms based on name and description
- Updates the app vocabulary with the generated synonyms
- Saves the updated vocabulary directly into the Qlik app

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v20 or later
- Access to a Qlik app (via QIX Engine API)
- Qlik Cloud API Key
- OpenAI API Key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jackBrioschi/Qlik-Smart-Vocabulary
cd Qlik-Smart-Vocabulary
```

2. Install Dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Duplicate the file .env.example and rename it .env.dev: fill the following variables of .end.dev file in the root directory

QLIK_CLOUD_APIKEY= your_qlikcloud_apikey

QLIK_CLOUD_TENANT=your-tenant-hostname.region.qlikcloud.com

QLIK_CLOUD_APPID=your_qlik_appid

OPENAI_APIKEY= your_openai_apikey

### Usage

Run the script:
```bash
node main.js
```
The script will:

1) Connect to the specified Qlik app

2) Fetch all master dimensions and measures

3) Send their names and descriptions to OpenAI for synonym enrichment: no sensitive information like values contained into each single master items are sent to OpenAI

4) Generate a vocabulary object

5) Save it back into the Qlik app
